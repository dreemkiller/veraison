          description:
            base64 encoded 32, 48, or 64 bytes random value

        expiry:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: >
            time (UTC ISO 8601 timestamp) at which the resource associated with
            the challenge-response session expires and may no longer exist. The
            client MUST assume that the challenge-response session is
            garbage-collected at the specified time.  This value is updated again
            at the transition between the "waiting" and "processing" states.

          description: >
            A new challenge-response session starts in "waiting" state.  It
            moves to state "processing" after Evidence has been successfully
            submitted, and to "complete" after the Attestation Result has been
            computed.  If an unrecoverable internal processing error is
            encountered, the state moves to "failed".

    Problem:

          description: >
            A URI reference [RFC3986] that identifies the problem type.  This
            specification encourages that, when dereferenced, it provide
            human-readable documentation for the problem type (e.g., using HTML
            [W3C.REC-html5-20141028]).  When this member is not present, its
            value is assumed to be "about:blank".
          example: about:blank
        title:
          type: string
          description: >
            A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.  It SHOULD NOT
            change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for
            purposes of localization (e.g., using proactive content
            negotiation; see [RFC7231], Section 3.4).
          example: Not Found

          description: >
            A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence
            of the problem.
          example: no active session could be located at the requested URL
        instance:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: >
            A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of
            the problem.  It may or may not yield further information if
            dereferenced.
