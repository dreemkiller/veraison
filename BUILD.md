# Make targets

The following `make(1)` targets can be invoked from everywhere:

* `make all` build all the plugins
* `make clean` remove all plugins
* `make test` run the unit tests with coverage information
* `make lint` run the code linter (requires [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)
